## 📝 How It Works
The Snake-neural-network uses a machine learning algorithm to teach a clanker how to play Snake. It learns through repeated gameplay and improves over time. Here’s an overview of how the learning process works:

1. The clanker plays the game repeatedly.
2. It learns from mistakes and adjusts its strategy.
3. Over time, it becomes better and achieves higher scores.

This project aims to demonstrate how AI can learn from its environment and improve through experience.

## 📃 Future Features
We have exciting plans for future updates:

- **Complexity Levels:** Introduce varying difficulty levels for the AI.
- **Play Against AI:** Enable users to play against the trained AI.
- **Additional Games:** Expand to other classic games like Tetris.

Stay tuned for updates!
